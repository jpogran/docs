  Editing Puppet wherever you need to
---

The Puppet Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Extension has been around for many years now. But the extension itself is just the beginning. What about editing code together like in Pair Programming? What about other Operating Systems? Does it even have to be on my local computer at all?

In the Puppetize2020 session, Puppet Pair Programming with Visual Studio Code, watch Glenn and James work through real life code problems inside a Puppet codebase while using modern tooling. They are continents apart but can work together as if they are in the same room through the power of the internet. While they work through the issues in their code base, youâ€™ll see how they use tools like VS Code with the Puppet Development Kit, WSL, Docker and even Github Codespaces!
